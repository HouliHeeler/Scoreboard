NBA Stats and Standings App

Description

    This project was built specifically for me. I was often unsatisfied with the various sites I would use to see the NBA scores and stats for the night, so I made exactly what I was looking for. The site is simple, uncluttered, and has a lot of room to easily add features.

Language Choices

    React was chosen to set up this project because it was a language that I wanted to spend a lot more time with. The project gave me a chance to use functionalities of it that I had not come across before, such as react-fast-marquee and react-dropdown and react-toastify.

Future of this Project

    This project has a lot more room to grow if I decide to pursue it further. In its current state, it shows me the scores of the night, with player stats, and favourite players stats scrolling across the marquee. It also has up to date standings. Nothing too flashy.

    Further functionality might include the following:

    -A page for season stats of the selected favourite players

    -The ability to show season stats for the team

    -A websocket tying in team Instagram feeds or tweets about chosen favourite players

Reflections

    For a seemingly simple project, there were a lot of things that took a great amount of learning, and trial and error, to get where I needed them to be. This has given me a much better grasp on React than I started with, and gave me the realization that there is still much more to learn within React, and within software development as a whole, and that I am looking forward to the process.
